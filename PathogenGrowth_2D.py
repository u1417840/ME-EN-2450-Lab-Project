# % function to compute the increase in icidence of a plant pathogen (or any
# % pathogen with stationary hosts).  This code is 2-D because it predicts 
# % the growth of the pathogen for a 2-D array of hosts each with a 
# % population that grows in size with time.  Additionally, it calculates 
# % airborne transmission of disease between hosts in the 2D array.  It is 
# % a modified version of the PathogenGrowth_0D function used in lab 09.
# %
# % The primary equations governing this are compound interest equations for
# % growth:
# %
# % dS/dt = -beta*S*I+dP/dt
# %
# % dL/dt = beta*S*I-mu_L*L+dE/dt
# %
# % dI/dt = mu_L*L*I-mu_I*I
# %
# % dP/dt = dB/dt + d(leaf)/dt 
# %
# % dR/dt = mu_I*I
# %
# % dE/dt = e
# %
# % dF/dt = Gamma*exp(alpha*I) - F*R_frac
# %
# % with:
# % S    = susceptible fraction of population (susceptible tissue)
# % beta = rate of infection growth for healthy population (fraction per day)
# % L    = fraction of tissue infected and latent (e.g., dormant before infection)
# % I    = fraction of tissue infected and producing inoculum
# % R    = fraction of tissue recovered (or removed) from population
# % P    = size of the total population (plant surface area)
# % B    = surface area of berries
# % E    = amount (fraction of population) of introduced disease from external sources
# % F    = size of the spreading population, e.g. sporulating for a fungus 
# % t    = time
# % mu_L = rate of decrease in latent population (fraction per day)
# % mu_I = rate of decrease in infectious population (fraction per day)
# % e    = rate of import from external sources
# %
# % inputs: vine (structure containing the initial size of susceptible population); beta; mu;
# % tspan (days to simulate array);
# % output: S,L,I,R,P,E,time (vector of simulation times), and B
