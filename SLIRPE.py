# SLIRPE function 
# % SLIRPE_model (pronounced like the 7-11 slushy drink) combines all the 
# % SLIR equations and the plant growth equations with an external source 
# % equation in one system. The dependent variables are stored in y as:
# % y(0) = B (amount of population, surface area, that is berries)
# % y(1) = P (total population, surface area, including berries and leaves: P = S+L+I+R)
# % y(2) = S (susceptible population)
# % y(3) = L (latent population)
# % y(4) = I (infectious population)
# % y(5) = R (recovered/removed population)
# % y(6) = E (amount of new infections from external sources)
# % y(7) = F (size of the spreading population, e.g. sporulating for a fungus) 
# %
# % and the parameters in a cell array:
# % p{0} = beta_max (max rate of colony growth/new infections)
# % p{1} = mu_i (inverse length of the infectious period in days)
# % p{2} = T (array of temperature in C)
# % p{3} = day (array of times in units of days)
# % p{4} = A (total plant surface area at reference time)
# % p{5} = Windspd (windspeed)
# % p{6} = Winddir (wind direction, currently not used here)
# % p{7} = eta     (release fraction scale factor)
# % p{8} = kappa   (release fraction scale factor)  
# % p{9}= xi      (release fraction offset)
# % p{10}= Gamma   (spore production multiple)
# % p{11}= alpha   (spore production 2nd factor)
# %
# % and the time input (idx) should be an integer for the iteration number
# % Note that E is not calculated by the function (only integrated in time)
